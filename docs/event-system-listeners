    class Listener(builtins.object)
     |  Listener(event_handler, type_id, force=False)
     |  
     |  Base Listener object. It should never be used. Use one of its subclasses
     |  instead.
     |  
     |  There cannot be more than one Listener with the same EventHandler listening
     |  to the same source. As a matter of fact, at Listener creation, if another
     |  Listener with the same EventHandler (for more detailed info on EventHandler
     |  equality, see docs for the EventHandler class) is found listening to the
     |  same source, that one is returned instead of creating a new one. This
     |  behaviour can be overridden by passing the 'force' flag, but is not
     |  recommended.
     |  
     |  Every Listener contains a static dictionary that maps a list of Listeners to
     |  the ID of an event. When a Listener starts listening to the event it is
     |  registered in the aforementioned dictionary and will be visible to the
     |  sources. When the same Listener will stop listening, it will be removed from
     |  the list.

     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, event_handler, type_id, force=False)
     |      Init for the Listener class. It takes in the 'event_handler'
     |      object and the 'type_id' of the event to which the Listener will listen.
     |  
     |  ignore(self)
     |      Stop listening to the event of type with id 'self.type_id'
     |  
     |  listen(self)
     |      Listen for the event of type with id 'self.type_id'
     |  
     |  notify(self, event_data)
     |      Execute the callback stored in 'self.event_handler' and pass to it
     |      'event_data'
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Class methods defined here:
     |  
     |  find_listener(event_handler, type_id) from builtins.type
     |      Get a Listener instance that has the same 'event_handler' from all the
     |      listeners listening to event with 'type_id'.
     |      If no Listener is found, return None.
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Static methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __new__(cls, event_handler, type_id, force=False)
     |      To avoid having multiple Listeners with the same EventHandler with
     |      the same source_id, the function searches for a Listener with the
     |      same EventHandler in the listeners dictionary using source_id as the
     |      key.
     |      If an equivalent Listener is not found, then a new one is created.
     |      
     |      This behaviour can be overridden by passing the force flag.
     |  
    
    class GameEventListener(Listener)
     |  GameEventListener(event_handler, type_id, force=False)
     |  
     |  Listener that listens to GameEvents.

    class GameObjectEventListener(Listener)
     |  GameObjectEventListener(event_handler, type_id, gobj_id, force=False)
     |  
     |  Listener that listens to GameObjectEvents.
     |  
     |  The GameObjectEventListener, due to the special nature of the
     |  GameObjectEvent, needs the GameObject ID of the GameObject that is tied to.
     |  This makes each GameObjectEvent visible only to listeners that have the same
     |  GameObject id as the source, not sharing said event with all listeners.

     |      object and the 'type_id' of the event to which the Listener will listen.
