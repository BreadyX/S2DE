NAME
    engine

DESCRIPTION
    Package containing all the logic to make the game work. This includes:
    - global variables (engine.vars);
    - event system (engine.eventsys);
    - scene system (engine.scene);
    - scene loading (engine.scene_loader);
    - gameobject system (engine.gameobject)
    - component system (engine.basecomponents)
    
    For more in depth documentation, read the docs for each of the
    module/subpackage.

    For easier access, all important classes have been exposed and won't require
    typing their module. For example, to use the GameObject class you can write
    'engine.GameObject' instead of 'engine.gameobject.GameObject'
