NAME
    tests

DESCRIPTION
    Module containing some helper methods that help testing the engine without
    the main loop running.
    
    Left kind of barren because this is a module that most likely the user will
    expand to add his own tests.

FUNCTIONS
    create_dummy_go(name, spawn)
        Create a dummy GameObject with name 'name'. This GameObject will have
        only a Transform and the 'spawn' bool decides whether it will be spawned or
        not.
    
    load_dummy_env()
        Loads a dummy environment containing one Scene called 'Dummy' with one
        spawned GameObject called 'Test1'
