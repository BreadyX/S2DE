# S2DE docs
Most of the documentation for the program is inside the code and can be easily
retrieved in a python interpreter with the `help()` built-in function:
```python
> ### Get info on gameobjects
> import engine # bring the engine into our namespace
> help(engine.gameobjects)
Help on module engine.gameobject in engine:
...
```

However, for comodity, I'm going to also leave here a copy of the documentation
divided by topic (for example 'engine-module.txt' and 'gameobjects.txt')

**USERS BE WARNED**: The documentation contained in those files might become
outdated or wrong/lacking. The in-code documentation, however, will always be 
up to date so it's best to consult both, if possible.
