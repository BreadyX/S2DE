NAME
    engine.eventsys.handling - Module that contains the EventHandler and EventData class.

CLASSES
    builtins.object
        EventData
        EventHandler
    
    class EventData(builtins.object)
     |  EventData(**kwargs)
     |  
     |  Class that is used by events to transfer all the data that they
     |  need to give the EventHandlers.
     |  
     |  It doesn't have any fixed instance fields, instead each key value pair
     |  passed to the constructor becomes one of the EventData's instance fields.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, **kwargs)
     |      Constructor for EventData. Each kwarg passed will become an instance
     |      field of the returned EventData.
    
    class EventHandler(builtins.object)
     |  EventHandler(callback, *args, **kwargs)
     |  
     |  An EventHandler is a class that holds a callback (a reference to a
     |  function) and the arguments (args or kwargs) that will be passed. The
     |  function inside the EventHandler can be then executed.
     |  
     |  EventHandlers are used by Listeners to execute functions when an event
     |  is launched.
     |  
     |  NOTE: Two EventHandlers are equal when the callback (the function) and its
     |  arguments are equal. So two EventHandlers pointing to the same function
     |  of two different instances of an object are different, but two
     |  EventHandlers pointing to the same function of the same instance of an
     |  object are equal.
     |  
     |  
     |  __eq__(self, other)
     |      Return true if callback and passed parameters are the same.
     |  
     |  __init__(self, callback, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Constructor for EventHandler. It takes a function 'callback' and the
     |      arguments to pass to it in form of args and kwargs. The self parameter
     |      should not be added to the arguments of the callback.
     |  
     |  __str__(self)
     |      Return a formatted string with the callback and its arguments.
     |  
     |  execute(self, event_data)
     |      Execute the callback.
     |      
     |      If 'event_data' is None, it is not passed: only the args and kwargs
     |      will be passed to the callback.
